# Policy Changes Related to Unemployment

This document summarizes key policy changes that have impacted unemployment rates in the United States over the years. It provides context for the analysis conducted in the accompanying Jupyter notebook.

## Key Policy Changes

February 2009 – Peak of the Great Recession
In February 2009, the U.S. unemployment rate rose to 8.1%, marking a significant increase from the previous year. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) was enacted shortly after, aiming to stimulate the economy through tax cuts, expansion of unemployment benefits, and funding for public works projects. 


August 2011 – Debt Ceiling Crisis and Economic Stagnation
The unemployment rate remained at 9.1% in August 2011 amid concerns over the U.S. debt ceiling crisis. The Budget Control Act was passed to resolve the crisis, introducing spending cuts that some economists feared could hinder job growth. 


February 2014 – Gradual Recovery Post-Recession
By February 2014, the unemployment rate had decreased to 6.7%. The economy added 175,000 jobs that month, reflecting ongoing recovery efforts, including Federal Reserve policies aimed at stimulating growth. 


August 2016 – Steady Employment Growth
In August 2016, the unemployment rate held steady at 4.9%. The economy added 151,000 jobs, indicating consistent, albeit moderate, employment growth during this period. 


May 2020 – COVID-19 Pandemic Impact
The unemployment rate in May 2020 was reported at 13.3%, a decrease from April's 14.7%, though actual figures may have been higher due to data collection challenges. The CARES Act provided economic relief, including expanded unemployment benefits and stimulus payments, to mitigate the pandemic's impact. 


August 2021 – Recovery Amid Delta Variant Concerns
By August 2021, the unemployment rate had declined to 5.2%. Job growth slowed, with 235,000 jobs added, as the Delta variant of COVID-19 raised concerns about the pace of economic recovery. 

## Conclusion

Understanding these policy changes is crucial for analyzing their effects on unemployment rates across different demographic groups. The accompanying analysis in the Jupyter notebook leverages this context to explore trends and disparities in unemployment.
