# Policy Changes Related to Unemployment

This document summarizes key policy changes that have impacted unemployment rates in the United States over the years. It provides context for the analysis conducted in the accompanying Jupyter notebook.

## Key Policy Changes

February 2009 – American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA)
The U.S. unemployment rate peaked at 8.1% amid the Great Recession. In response, the ARRA was enacted to stimulate economic growth through tax cuts, expanded unemployment benefits, and infrastructure spending.

January 2012 – Continued Recovery with Slow Progress
No major new legislation occurred immediately before January 2012, but the U.S. economy was in a slow recovery phase from the 2008 crisis. Policies already in effect, such as ARRA and Federal Reserve stimulus programs, continued to influence unemployment trends.

December 2014 – Effects of Federal Reserve Policies
The unemployment rate continued to decline due to sustained economic growth and accommodative monetary policies by the Federal Reserve. No new fiscal policies were enacted immediately before this date, but prior measures and a stable recovery environment helped improve employment figures.

June 2017 – Regulatory Rollbacks Begin
Leading into mid-2017, the new administration prioritized deregulation and tax reform planning. While major legislation had yet to be passed, expectations of pro-business policies contributed to market confidence and gradual job growth.

May 2020 – CARES Act in Response to COVID-19
Unemployment spiked due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act, passed in March 2020, provided expanded unemployment benefits, direct stimulus payments, and support for businesses, helping to ease the impact in subsequent months like May.

August 2021 – Slower Recovery Amid Delta Variant
By August 2021, the unemployment rate had declined to 5.2%. Recovery efforts continued under the American Rescue Plan, though concerns over the Delta variant contributed to slower job growth and uncertainty in the labor market.


## Conclusion

Understanding these policy changes is crucial for analyzing their effects on unemployment rates across different demographic groups. The accompanying analysis in the Jupyter notebook leverages this context to explore trends and disparities in unemployment.
